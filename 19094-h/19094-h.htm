<div class="hanging2"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A plantation of thin young trees, in a misty
and rainy twilight; some woodland blossom showing
the patches on the earth between the stems.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging2"><p><span class="smcap">The Stranger</span> <i>is discovered, a cloaked figure with
a pointed hood. His costume might belong to
modern or any other time, and the conical hood
is so drawn over the head that little can be seen
of the face.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging2"><p><i>A distant voice, a woman's, is heard, half-singing,
half-chanting, unintelligible words. The
cloaked figure raises its head and listens with
interest. The song draws nearer and</i> <span class="smcap">Patricia
Carleon</span> <i>enters. She is dark and slight, and
has a dreamy expression. Though she is
artistically dressed, her hair is a little wild.
She has a broken branch of some flowering tree
in her hand. She does not notice the stranger,
and though he has watched her with interest,
makes no sign. Suddenly she perceives him
and starts back.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Oh! Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> Ah! Who am I? [<i>Commences to mutter
to himself, and maps out the ground with his staff.</i>]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a hat, but not to wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wear a sword, but not to slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever in my bag I bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pack of cards, but not to play.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What are you? What are you
saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> It is the language of the fairies, O
daughter of Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> But I never thought fairies were
like you. Why, you are taller than I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> We are of such stature as we will.
But the elves grow small, not large, when they
would mix with mortals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> You mean they are beings greater
than we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> Daughter of men, if you would see
a fairy as he truly is, look for his head above all
the stars and his feet amid the floors of the sea.
Old women have taught you that the fairies are
too small to be seen. But I tell you the fairies
are too mighty to be seen. For they are the elder
gods before whom the giants were like pigmies.
They are the Elemental Spirits, and any one of
them is larger than the world. And you look for
them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that
you never see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> But you come in the shape and size
of a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> Because I would speak with a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Drawing back in awe.</i>] I think
you are growing taller as you speak.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>The scene appears to fade away, and give
place to the milieu of</i> <span class="smcap">Act One</span>, <i>the
Duke's drawing-room, an apartment with
open French windows or any opening
large enough to show a garden and one
house fairly near. It is evening, and
there is a red lamp lighted in the house
beyond. The</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. Cyril Smith</span> <i>is
sitting with hat and umbrella beside him,
evidently a visitor. He is a young man
with the highest of High Church dog-collars
and all the qualities of a restrained
fanatic. He is one of the Christian
Socialist sort and takes his priesthood
seriously. He is an honest man, and
not an ass.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>To him enters</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Hastings</span> <i>with papers
in his hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> Oh, good evening. You are Mr.
Smith. [<i>Pause.</i>] I mean you are the Rector, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I am the Rector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> I am the Duke's secretary. His
Grace asks me to say that he hopes to see you very
soon; but he is engaged just now with the Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Is the Duke ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Oh, no; the Doctor
has come to ask him to help some cause or
other. The Duke is never ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Is the Doctor with him now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> Why, strictly speaking, he is not.
The Doctor has gone over the road to fetch a paper
connected with his proposal. But he hasn't far
to go, as you can see. That's his red lamp at the
end of his grounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes, I know. I am much obliged to
you. I will wait as long as is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> [<i>Cheerfully.</i>] Oh, it won't be very
long. </p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Enter by the garden doors</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Grimthorpe</span>
<i>reading an open paper. He is an old-fashioned
practitioner, very much of a
gentleman and very carefully dressed in
a slightly antiquated style. He is about
sixty years old and might have been a
friend of Huxley's.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Folding up the paper.</i>] I beg your
pardon, sir, I did not notice there was anyone
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Amicably.</i>] I beg yours. A new
clergyman cannot expect to be expected. I only
came to see the Duke about some local affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] And so, oddly enough,
did I. But I suppose we should both like to get
hold of him by a separate ear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Oh, there's no disguise as far as I'm
concerned. I've joined this league for starting a
model public-house in the parish; and in plain
words, I've come to ask his Grace for a subscription
to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Grimly.</i>] And, as it happens, I have
joined in the petition against the erection of a
model public-house in this parish. The similarity
of our position grows with every instant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes, I think we must have been twins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>More good-humouredly.</i>] Well, what
is a model public-house? Do you mean a toy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I mean a place where Englishmen can
get decent drink and drink it decently. Do you
call that a toy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> No; I should call that a conjuring trick.
Or, in apology to your cloth, I will say a miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I accept the apology to my cloth. I
am doing my duty as a priest. How can the
Church have a right to make men fast if she does
not allow them to feast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] And when you have done
feasting them, you will send them to me to be
cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes; and when you've done curing
them you'll send them to me to be buried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>After a pause, laughing.</i>] Well, you
have all the old doctrines. It is only fair you
should have all the old jokes too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Laughing also.</i>] By the way, you call
it a conjuring trick that poor people should drink
moderately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I call it a chemical discovery that
alcohol is not a food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You don't drink wine yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Mildly startled.</i>] Drink wine! Well&mdash;what
else is there to drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> So drinking decently is a conjuring
trick that you can do, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Still good-humouredly.</i>] Well, well,
let us hope so. Talking about conjuring tricks,
there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things
here this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Conjuring? Indeed? Why is that?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> <i>with a letter in each hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> His Grace will be with you presently.
He asked me to deal with the business matter
first of all.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>He gives a note to each of them.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Turning eagerly to the</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor.</span>] But
this is rather splendid. The Duke's given &pound;50 to
the new public-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> The Duke is very liberal.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Collects papers.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Examining his cheque.</i>] Very. But
this is rather curious. He has also given &pound;50 to
the league for opposing the new public-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> The Duke is very liberal-minded. </p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Staring at his cheque.</i>] Liberal-minded!...
Absent-minded, I should call it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Sitting down and lighting a cigar.</i>]
Well, yes. The Duke does suffer a little from
absence [<i>puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls during
the pause</i>] of mind. He is all for compromise.
Don't you know the kind of man who, when you
talk to him about the five best breeds of dog, always
ends up by buying a mongrel? The Duke is the
kindest of men, and always trying to please
everybody. He generally finishes by pleasing
nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes; I think I know the sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Take this conjuring, for instance.
You know the Duke has two wards who are to
live with him now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes. I heard something about a
nephew and niece from Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> The niece came from Ireland some
months ago, but the nephew comes back from
America to-night. [<i>He gets up abruptly and walks
about the room.</i>] I think I will tell you all about
it. In spite of your precious public-house you
seem to me to be a sane man. And I fancy I shall
want all the sane men I can get to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Rising also.</i>] I am at your service.
Do you know, I rather guessed you did not come
here only to protest against my precious public-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Striding about in subdued excitement.</i>]
Well, you guessed right. I was family
physician to the Duke's brother in Ireland. I
knew the family pretty well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Quietly.</i>] I suppose you mean you
knew something odd about the family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, they saw fairies and things of
that sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> And I suppose, to the medical mind, seeing
fairies means much the same as seeing snakes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With a sour smile.</i>] Well, they saw
them in Ireland. I suppose it's quite correct to
see fairies in Ireland. It's like gambling at Monte
Carlo. It's quite respectable. But I do draw
the line at their seeing fairies in England. I do
object to their bringing their ghosts and goblins
and witches into the poor Duke's own back garden
and within a yard of my own red lamp. It shows
a lack of tact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> But I do understand that the Duke's
nephew and niece see witches and fairies between
here and your lamp.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>He walks to the garden window and looks out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, the nephew has been in America.
It stands to reason you can't see fairies in
America. But there is this sort of superstition
in the family, and I am not easy in my mind about
the girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Why, what does she do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Oh, she wanders about the park and
the woods in the evenings. Damp evenings for
choice. She calls it the Celtic twilight. I've no
use for the Celtic twilight myself. It has a tendency
to get on the chest. But what is worse, she
is always talking about meeting somebody, some
elf or wizard or something. I don't like it at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Have you told the Duke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With a grim smile.</i>] Oh, yes, I told
the Duke. The result was the conjurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>With amazement.</i>] The <i>conjurer</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Puts down his cigar in the ash-tray.</i>]
The Duke is indescribable. He will be here presently,
and you shall judge for yourself. Put two
or three facts or ideas before him, and the thing
he makes out of them is always something that
seems to have nothing to do with it. Tell any
other human being about a girl dreaming of the
fairies and her practical brother from America,
and he would settle it in some obvious way and
satisfy some one: send her to America or let her
have her fairies in Ireland. Now the Duke thinks
a conjurer would just meet the case. I suppose
he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up,
and somehow satisfy the believers' interest in
supernatural things and the unbelievers' interest
in smart things. As a matter of fact the unbeliever
thinks the conjurer's a fraud, and the
believer thinks he's a fraud, too. The conjurer
satisfies nobody. That is why he satisfies the
Duke.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Hastings</span>, <i>carrying
papers. The</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>is a healthy, hearty
man in tweeds, with a rather wandering
eye. In the present state of the peerage
it is necessary to explain that the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>,
<i>though an ass, is a gentleman.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. Good-morning, Mr. Smith. So sorry
to have kept you waiting, but we're rather in a
rush to-day. [<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Hastings</span>, <i>who has gone
over to a table with the papers.</i>] You know Mr.
Carleon is coming this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings</span>. Yes, your Grace. His train will
be in by now. I have sent the trap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. Thank you. [<i>Turning to the other two.</i>]
My nephew, Dr. Grimthorpe, Morris, you know,
Miss Carleon's brother from America. I hear
he's been doing great things out there. Petrol,
or something. Must move with the times, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>. I'm afraid Mr. Smith doesn't always
agree with moving with the times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. Oh, come, come! Progress, you know,
progress! Of course I know how busy you are;
you mustn't overwork yourself, you know. Hastings
was telling me you laughed over those subscriptions
of mine. Well, well, I believe in looking
at both sides of a question, you know. Aspects,
as old Buffle called them. Aspects. [<i>With an
all-embracing gesture of the arm.</i>] You represent
the tendency to drink in moderation, and you do
good in <i>your</i> way. The Doctor represents the
tendency not to drink at all; and he does good in
<i>his</i> way. We can't be Ancient Britons, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. [<i>With unabated cheerfulness.</i>] I saw
the place you're putting up for it, Mr. Smith.
Very good work. Very good work, indeed. Art
for the people, eh? I particularly liked that woodwork
over the west door&mdash;I'm glad to see you're

reminds one of the French Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. Delighted to see you, my dear boy.
I hear you've been doing very well for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris</span>. [<i>Laughing.</i>] Well, pretty well, Duke;

<p><span class="smcap">Morris</span>. It's a mighty chilly night to choose.
Does my sister commonly select such evenings to
take the air&mdash;and the damp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor</span>. [<i>After a pause</i>.] If I may say so, I
quite agree with you. I have often taken the
liberty of warning your sister against going out
in all weathers like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. [<i>Expansively waving his hands about</i>.]
The artist temperament! What I always call the

and all that. </p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Silence</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris</span>. [<i>Staring</i>.] All what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Continuing to lecture with enthusiasm.</i>]
Why, everything's temperament, you know! It's
her temperament to see the fairies. It's my temperament
not to see the fairies. Why, I've walked
all round the grounds twenty times and never saw
a fairy. Well, it's like that about this wizard or
whatever she calls it. For her there is somebody
there. For us there would not be somebody
there. Don't you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Advancing excitedly.</i>] Somebody
there! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Airily.</i>] Well, you can't quite call it
a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] A man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, as old Buffle used to say, what is
a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>With a strong rise of the American
accent.</i>] With your permission, Duke, I eliminate
old Buffle. Do you mean that anybody has had
the tarnation coolness to suggest that some man....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Oh, not a <i>man</i>, you know. A magician,
something mythical, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Not a <i>man</i>, but a medicine man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Grimly.</i>] I am a medicine man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And you don't look mythical, Doc.</p>

<div class="hanging">[<i>He bites his finger and begins to pace restlessly

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, you know, the artistic temperament....</p>

In most commercial ways we're a pretty forward

be a pretty backward country. And if you ask
me whether I like my sister walking about the
woods on a night like this! Well, I don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I am afraid you Americans aren't so

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Patricia Carleon</span></p>

<p>[<i>Still agitated.</i>] Patricia, where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Rather wearily.</i>] Oh! in Fairyland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Genially.</i>] And whereabouts is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> It's rather different from other
places. It's either nowhere or it's wherever you
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Sharply.</i>] Has it any inhabitants?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Generally only two. Oneself and
one's shadow. But whether he is my shadow or
I am his shadow is never found out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> He? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Seeming to understand his annoyance
for the first time, and smiling.</i>] Oh, you needn't
get conventional about it, Morris. He is not a
mortal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> What's his name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> We have no names there. You
never really know anybody if you know his
name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> What does he look like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I have only met him in the twilight.
He seems robed in a long cloak, with a peaked cap
or hood like the elves in my nursery stories.
Sometimes when I look out of the window here,
I see him passing round this house like a shadow;
and see his pointed hood, dark against the sunset
or the rising of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> What does he talk about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> He tells me the truth. Very many
true things. He is a wizard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> How do you know he's a wizard? I
suppose he plays some tricks on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I should know he was a wizard if he
played no tricks. But once he stooped and picked
up a stone and cast it into the air, and it flew up
into God's heaven like a bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Was that what first made you think
he was a wizard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Oh, no. When I first saw him he
was tracing circles and pentacles in the grass and
talking the language of the elves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Sceptically.</i>] Do you know the language
of the elves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Not until I heard it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Lowering his voice as if for his sister,
but losing patience so completely that he talks much
louder than he imagines.</i>] See here, Patricia, I
reckon this kind of thing is going to be the limit.
I'm just not going to have you let in by some
blamed tramp or fortune-teller because you choose
to read minor poetry about the fairies. If this
gipsy or whatever he is troubles you again....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Putting his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Morris's</span> <i>shoulder.</i>]
Come, you must allow a little more for
poetry. We can't all feed on nothing but petrol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Quite right, quite right. And being
Irish, don't you know, Celtic, as old Buffle used
to say, charming songs, you know, about the Irish
girl who has a plaid shawl&mdash;and a Banshee.
[<i>Sighs profoundly.</i>] Poor old Gladstone!</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Silence as usual.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Speaking to</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor.</span>] I thought you
yourself considered the family superstition bad
for the health?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I consider a family superstition is
better for the health than a family quarrel. [<i>He
walks casually across to</i> <span class="smcap">Patricia.</span>] Well, it must
be nice to be young and still see all those stars and
sunsets. We old buffers won't be too strict with
you if your view of things sometimes gets a bit&mdash;mixed
up, shall we say? If the stars get loose
about the grass by mistake; or if, once or twice,
the sunset gets into the east. We should only
say, "Dream as much as you like. Dream for all
mankind. Dream for us who can dream no longer.
But do not quite forget the difference."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What difference?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> The difference between the things
that are beautiful and the things that are there.
That red lamp over my door isn't beautiful; but
it's there. You might even come to be glad it is
there, when the stars of gold and silver have
faded. I am an old man now, but some men are
still glad to find my red star. I do not say they
are the wise men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Somewhat affected.</i>] Yes, I know
you are good to everybody. But don't you think
there may be floating and spiritual stars which
will last longer than the red lamps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>With decision.</i>] Yes. But they are
fixed stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> The red lamp will last my time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Capital! Capital! Why, it's like
Tennyson. [<i>Silence.</i>] I remember when I was
an undergrad....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Nonsense! [<i>Rushes to the garden
doors.</i>] It's only somebody standing in front of
it. Say, Duke, there's somebody standing in the
garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Calmly.</i>] I told you he walked

to something of the Doctor's agnosticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Excited, and turning almost with a
snarl.</i>] I didn't know you parsons stuck up for
any fables but your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I stick up for the thing every man has
a right to. Perhaps the only thing that every
man has a right to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> The benefit of the doubt. Even your
master, the petroleum millionaire, has a right to
that. And I think he needs it more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I don't think there's much doubt
about the question, Minister. I've met this sort
of fellow often enough&mdash;the sort of fellow who
wheedles money out of girls by telling them he
can make stones disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger.</span>] Do you say
you can make stones disappear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> Yes. I can make stones disappear.</p>

of tough who knows how to make a watch and
chain disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> Yes; I know how to make a watch
and chain disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And I should think you were pretty
good at disappearing yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger.</span> I have done such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>With a sneer.</i>] Will you disappear
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> There are only a few small matters.
Here are the programmes of the entertainment
your Grace wanted. Mr. Carleon wishes to see
them very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Thanks, thanks. [<i>Takes the programmes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> Shall I carry them for your Grace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> No, no; I shan't forget, I shan't forget.
Why, you've no idea how businesslike I am. We
have to be, you know. [<i>Vaguely.</i>] I know you're
a bit of a Socialist; but I assure you there's a good
deal to do&mdash;stake in the country, and all that.
Look at remembering faces now! The King never
forgets faces. [<i>Waves the programmes about.</i>] I
never forget faces. [<i>Catches sight of the</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>
<i>and genially draws him into the discussion.</i>] Why,
the Professor here who performs before the King
[<i>puts down the programmes</i>]&mdash;you see it on the
caravans, you know&mdash;performs before the King
almost every night, I suppose....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I sometimes let his
Majesty have an evening off. And turn my
attention, of course, to the very highest nobility.
But naturally I have performed before every
sovereign potentate, white and black. There
never was a conjurer who hadn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> That's right, that's right! And you'll
say with me that the great business for a King is
remembering people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I should say it was remembering
which people to remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, well, now.... [<i>Looks round
rather wildly for something.</i>] Being really businesslike....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> Shall I take the programmes for
your Grace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Picking them up.</i>] No, no, I shan't
forget. Is there anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> I have to go down the village about
the wire to Stratford. The only other thing at all
urgent is the Militant Vegetarians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Ah! The Militant Vegetarians! You've
heard of them, I'm sure. Won't obey the law
[<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>] so long as the Government serves
out meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Let them be comforted. There
are a good many people who don't get much meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, well, I'm bound to say they're
very enthusiastic. Advanced, too&mdash;oh, certainly
advanced. Like Joan of Arc.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Short silence, in which the</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span> <i>stares
at him.</i>]</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> <i>Was</i> Joan of Arc a Vegetarian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Oh, well, it's a very high ideal, after all.
The Sacredness of Life, you know&mdash;the Sacredness
of Life. [<i>Shakes his head.</i>] But they carry it too
far. They killed a policeman down in Kent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Killed a policeman? How Vegetarian!
Well, I suppose it was, so long as they
didn't eat him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> They are asking only for small subscriptions.
Indeed, they prefer to collect a large
number of half-crowns, to prove the popularity of
their movement. But I should advise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Oh, give them three shillings, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> If I might suggest....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Hang it all! We gave the Anti-Vegetarians
three shillings. It seems only fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> If I might suggest anything, I
think your Grace will be wise not to subscribe in
this case. The Anti-Vegetarians have already
used their funds to form gangs ostensibly to protect
their own meetings. And if the Vegetarians
use theirs to break up the meetings&mdash;well, it will
look rather funny that we have paid roughs on
both sides. It will be rather difficult to explain
when it comes before the magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> But I shall be the magistrate. [<span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>
<i>stares at him again</i>.] That's the system, my
dear Hastings, that's the advantage of the system.
Not a logical system&mdash;no Rousseau in it&mdash;but see
how well it works! I shall be the very best magistrate
that could be on the Bench. The others
would be biassed, you know. Old Sir Lawrence is
a Vegetarian himself; and might be hard on the
Anti-Vegetarian roughs. Colonel Crashaw would
be sure to be hard on the Vegetarian roughs. But
if I've paid both of 'em, of course I shan't be hard
on either of 'em&mdash;and there you have it. Just
perfect impartiality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings.</span> [<i>Restrainedly.</i>] Shall I take the

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Heartily.</i>] No, no; I won't forget 'em.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hastings</span>.] Well, Professor, what's the

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I fear there is never any news in

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Don't you have a newspaper or something?
Everybody has a newspaper now, you
know. The&mdash;er&mdash;Daily Sword-Swallower or that

myself; but I think journalism and conjuring will
always be incompatible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Incompatible&mdash;Oh, but that's where I
differ&mdash;that's where I take larger views! Larger
laws, as old Buffle said. Nothing's <i>incompatible</i>,
you know&mdash;except husband and wife and so on;
you must talk to Morris about that. It's wonderful
the way incompatibility has gone forward in
the States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I only mean that the two trades
rest on opposite principles. The whole point of
being a conjurer is that you won't explain a thing
that has happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, and the journalist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Well, the whole point of being a
journalist is that you do explain a thing that
hasn't happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> But you'll want somewhere to discuss
the new tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> There are no new tricks. And if
there were we shouldn't want 'em discussed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I'm afraid you're not <i>really</i> advanced.
Are you interested in modern progress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes. We are interested in all
tricks done by illusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, well, I must go and see how
Morris is. Pleasure of seeing you later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Why are nice men such asses?
[<i>Turns to arrange the table.</i>] That seems all right.
The pack of cards that is a pack of cards. And the
pack of cards that isn't a pack of cards. The hat
that looks like a gentleman's hat. But which, in
reality, is no gentleman's hat. Only my hat; and
I am not a gentleman. I am only a conjurer, and
this is only a conjurer's hat. I could not take off
this hat to a lady. I can take rabbits out of it,
goldfish out of it, snakes out of it. Only I mustn't
take my own head out of it. I suppose I'm a
lower animal than a rabbit or a snake. Anyhow
they can get out of the conjurer's hat; and I can't.
I am a conjurer and nothing else but a conjurer.
Unless I could show I was something else, and that
would be worse.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>He begins to dash the cards rather irregularly

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Still dashing cards about the table.</i>]
Miss Carleon, might I speak to you a moment?
[<i>He puts his hands in his pockets, stares at the table;
and his face assumes a sardonic expression.</i>] The
question is purely practical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Pausing at the door.</i>] I can hardly
imagine what the question can be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I am the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> And what have I to do with that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> You have everything to do with it.
I am the question: you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Angrily.</i>] Well, what am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> You are the answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> The answer to what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Coming round to the front of the
table and sitting against it.</i>] The answer to me.
You think I'm a liar because I walked about the
fields with you and said I could make stones disappear.
Well, so I can. I'm a conjurer. In
mere point of fact, it wasn't a lie. But if it had
been a lie I should have told it just the same. I
would have told twenty such lies. You may or
may not know why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I know nothing about such lies.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>She puts her hand on the handle of the door,

sincere soliloquy.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I don't know whether you have any
notion of what it means to a man like me to talk to
a lady like you, even on false pretences. I am an
adventurer. I am a blackguard, if one can earn
the title by being in all the blackguard societies of
the world. I have thought everything out by
myself, when I was a guttersnipe in Fleet Street, or,
lower still, a journalist in Fleet Street. Before I
met you I never guessed that rich people ever
thought at all. Well, that is all I have to say.
We had some good conversations, didn't we? I
am a liar. But I told you a great deal of the
truth.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>He turns and resumes the arrangement of the
table.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Thinking.</i>] Yes, you did tell me a
great deal of the truth. You told me hundreds
and thousands of truths. But you never told me
the truth that one wants to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> And what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Turning back into the room.</i>] You
never told me the truth about yourself. You
never told me you were only the Conjurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I did not tell you that because I do
not even know it. I do not know whether I am
only the Conjurer....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Sometimes I am afraid I am something
worse than the Conjurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] I cannot think of anything
worse than a conjurer who does not call
himself a conjurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Gloomily.</i>] There is something
worse. [<i>Rallying himself.</i>] But that is not what
I want to say. Do you really find that very
unpardonable? Come, let me put you a case.
Never mind about whether it is our case. A man
spends his time incessantly in going about in
third-class carriages to fifth-rate lodgings. He has
to make up new tricks, new patter, new nonsense,
sometimes every night of his life. Mostly he has
to do it in the beastly black cities of the Midlands
and the North, where he can't get out into the
country. Now and again he does it at some
gentleman's country-house, where he can get out
into the country. Well, you know that actors
and orators and all sorts of people like to rehearse
their effects in the open air if they can. [<i>Smiles.</i>]
You know that story of the great statesman who
was heard by his own gardener saying, as he paced
the garden, "Had I, Mr. Speaker, received the
smallest intimation that I could be called upon to
speak this evening...." [<span class="smcap">Patricia</span> <i>controls a
smile, and he goes on with overwhelming enthusiasm.</i>]
Well, conjurers are just the same. It takes some
time to prepare an impromptu. A man like that
walks about the woods and fields doing all his
tricks beforehand, and talking all sorts of gibberish
because he thinks he is alone. One evening this
man found he was not alone. He found a very
beautiful child was watching him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> A child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes. That was his first impression.
He is an intimate friend of mine. I have known
him all my life. He tells me he has since discovered
she is not a child. She does not fulfil the definition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What is the definition of a child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Somebody you can play with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Abruptly.</i>] Why did you wear that
cloak with the hood up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I think it escaped your
notice that it was raining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Smiling faintly.</i>] And what did
this friend of yours do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> You have already told me what he
did. He destroyed a fairy tale, for he created a
fairy tale that he was bound to destroy. [<i>Swinging
round suddenly on the table.</i>] But do you blame
a man very much, Miss Carleon, if he enjoyed the
only fairy tale he had had in his life? Suppose he
said the silly circles he was drawing for practice
were really magic circles? Suppose he said the
bosh he was talking was the language of the elves?
Remember, he has read fairy tales as much as you
have. Fairy tales are the only democratic institutions.
All the classes have heard all the fairy tales.
Do you blame him very much if he, too, tried to
have a holiday in fairyland?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Simply.</i>] I blame him less than I
did. But I still say there can be nothing worse
than false magic. And, after all, it was he who
brought the false magic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Rising from his seat.</i>] Yes. It
was she who brought the real magic.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Morris</span>, <i>in evening-dress. He walks
straight up to the conjuring-table; and
picks up one article after another, putting
each down with a comment.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I know that one. I know that. I
know that. Let's see, that's the false bottom, I
think. That works with a wire. I know
that; it goes up the sleeve. That's the false bottom
again. That's the substituted pack of cards&mdash;that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Really, Morris, you mustn't talk as
if you knew everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Oh, I don't mind anyone knowing
everything, Miss Carleon. There is something
that is much more important than knowing how
a thing is done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And what's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Knowing how to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Becoming nasal again in anger.</i>] That's
so, eh? Being the high-toned conjurer because
you can't any longer take all the sidewalk as a
fairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Crossing the room and speaking
seriously to her brother.</i>] Really, Morris, you are
very rude. And it's quite ridiculous to be rude.
This gentleman was only practising some tricks by
himself in the garden. [<i>With a certain dignity.</i>]
If there was any mistake, it was mine. Come,
shake hands, or whatever men do when they
apologize. Don't be silly. He won't turn you
into a bowl of goldfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Reluctantly.</i>] Well, I guess that's
so. [<i>Offering his hand.</i>] Shake. [<i>They shake
hands.</i>] And you won't turn me into a bowl of
goldfish anyhow, Professor. I understand that
when you do produce a bowl of goldfish, they are
generally slips of carrot. That is so, Professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Sharply.</i>] Yes. [<i>Produces a bowl
of goldfish from his tail pockets and holds it under
the other's nose.</i>] Judge for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>In monstrous excitement.</i>] Very
good! Very good! But I know how that's done&mdash;I
know how that's done. You have an india-rubber
cap, you know, or cover....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Goes back gloomily to his table and sits on it,
picking up a pack of cards and balancing
it in his hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Ah, most mysteries are tolerably
plain if you know the apparatus. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, <i>talking with grave faces, but growing

had all the old apparatus of all the old Priests and
Prophets since the beginning of the world. I
guess most of the old miracles and that were a
matter of just panel and wires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I don't quite understand you.
What old apparatus do you want so much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Breaking out with all the frenzy of the
young free-thinker.</i>] Well, sir, I just want that old
apparatus that turned rods into snakes. I want
those smart appliances, sir, that brought water out
of a rock when old man Moses chose to hit it. I
guess it's a pity we've lost the machinery. I would
like to have those old conjurers here that called
themselves Patriarchs and Prophets in your
precious Bible....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Morris, you mustn't talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Well, I don't believe in religion....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Hush, hush. Nobody but
women believe in religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Humorously.</i>] I think this is a
fitting opportunity to show you another ancient
conjuring trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Which one is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> The Vanishing Lady!</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Patricia.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> There is one part of their old apparatus
I regret especially being lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Still excited.</i>] Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> The apparatus for writing the Book of
Job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Well, well, they didn't know everything
in those old times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> No, and in those old times they knew
they didn't. [<i>Dreamily.</i>] Where shall wisdom be
found, and what is the place of understanding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Somewhere in America, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Still dreamily.</i>] Man knoweth not the
price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the
living. The deep sayeth it is not in me, the sea
sayeth it is not with me. Death and destruction
say we have heard tell of it. God understandeth
the way thereof and He knoweth the place thereof.
For He looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth
under the whole Heaven. But to man He hath
said: Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom,
and to depart from evil is understanding.
[<i>Turns suddenly to the</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>.] How's that for
Agnosticism, Dr. Grimthorpe? What a pity that
apparatus is lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Well, you may just smile how you
choose, I reckon. But I say the Conjurer here
could be the biggest man in the big blessed centuries
if he could just show us how the Holy old
tricks were done. We must say this for old man
Moses, that he was in advance of his time. When
he did the old tricks they were new tricks. He got
the pull on the public. He could do his tricks
before grown men, great bearded fighting men who
could win battles and sing Psalms. But this
modern conjuring is all behind the times. That's
why they only do it with schoolboys. There isn't
a trick on that table I don't know. The whole
trade's as dead as mutton; and not half so satisfying.
Why he [<i>pointing to the</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>] brought
out a bowl of goldfish just now&mdash;an old trick that
anybody could do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Oh, I quite agree. The apparatus
is perfectly simple. By the way, let me have a
look at those goldfish of yours, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Angrily.</i>] I'm not a paid play-actor
come here to conjure. I'm not here to do stale
tricks; I'm here to see through 'em. I say it's an
old trick and....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> True. But as you said, we never
show it except to schoolboys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And may I ask you, Professor Hocus
Pocus, or whatever your name is, whom you are
calling a schoolboy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I beg your pardon. Your sister will
tell you I am sometimes mistaken about children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I forbid you to appeal to my sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> That is exactly what a schoolboy
would do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>With abrupt and dangerous calm.</i>]
I am not a schoolboy, Professor. I am a quiet
business man. But I tell you in the country I
come from, the hand of a quiet business man goes
to his hip pocket at an insult like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Fiercely.</i>] Let it go to his pocket!
I thought the hand of a quiet business man more
often went to someone else's pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> You....</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Puts his hand to his hip. The</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>puts
his hand on his shoulder.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Gentlemen, I think you are both
forgetting yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Perhaps. [<i>His tone sinks suddenly
to weariness.</i>] I ask pardon for what I said. It
was certainly in excess of the young gentleman's
deserts. [<i>Sighs.</i>] I sometimes rather wish I
could forget myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> [<i>Sullenly, after a pause.</i>] Well, the
entertainment's coming on; and you English don't
like a scene. I reckon I'll have to bury the
blamed old hatchet too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With a certain dignity, his social
type shining through his profession.</i>] Mr. Carleon,
you will forgive an old man, who knew your father
well, if he doubts whether you are doing yourself
justice in treating yourself as an American Indian,
merely because you have lived in America. In
my old friend Huxley's time we of the middle
classes disbelieved in reason and all sorts of things.
But we did believe in good manners. It is a pity
if the aristocracy can't. I don't like to hear you
say you are a savage and have buried a tomahawk.
I would rather hear you say, as your
Irish ancestors would have said, that you have
sheathed your sword with the dignity proper to a
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Very well. I've sheathed my sword
with the dignity proper to a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> And I have sheathed my sword
with the dignity proper to a conjurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> How does the Conjurer sheath a sword?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Swallows it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Then we all agree there shall be no
quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> May I say a word? I have a great
dislike of a quarrel, for a reason quite beyond
my duty to my cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I object to a quarrel because it always
interrupts an argument. May I bring you back
for a moment to the argument? You were saying
that these modern conjuring tricks are simply the
old miracles when they have once been found out.
But surely another view is possible. When we
speak of things being sham, we generally mean
that they are imitations of things that are genuine.
Take that Reynolds over there of the Duke's
great-grandfather. [<i>Points to a picture on the
wall.</i>] If I were to say it was a copy....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Wal, the Duke's real amiable; but I
reckon you'd find what you call the interruption
of an argument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Well, suppose I did say so, you wouldn't
take it as meaning that Sir Joshua Reynolds never
lived. Why should sham miracles prove to us
that real Saints and Prophets never lived. There
may be sham magic and real magic also.</p>

<div class="hanging">

because there are real ghosts. There may be
theatrical fairies precisely because there are real

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> I hope the Professor enjoys being

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Almost as much as being called the
Prospectus of some American Companies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Gentlemen! Gentlemen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> Wal, let's have the argument first,
then I guess we can have the quarrel afterwards.
I'll clean this house of some encumbrances. See
here, Mr. Smith, I'm not putting anything on your
real miracle notion. I say, and Science says, that
there's a cause for everything. Science will find out
that cause, and sooner or later your old miracle will
look mighty mean. Sooner or later Science will botanise
a bit on your turnip ghosts; and make you look
turnips yourselves for having taken any. I say....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>In a low voice to</i> <span class="smcap">Smith</span>.] I don't like
this peaceful argument of yours. The boy is
getting much too excited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> You say old man Reynolds lived; and
Science don't say no. [<i>He turns excitedly to the
picture.</i>] But I guess he's dead now; and you'll
no more raise your Saints and Prophets from the
dead than you'll raise the Duke's great-grandfather
to dance on that wall.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>The picture begins to sway slightly to and fro

<p><span class="smcap">Morris.</span> And you reckoned I shouldn't know.
[<i>Laughs with a high crowing laugh.</i>] That's how

when you talked about that red lamp of yours.
That red lamp is the light of science that will put
out all the lanterns of your turnip ghosts. It's
a consuming fire, Doctor, but it is the red light of
the morning. [<i>Points at it in exalted enthusiasm.</i>]
Your priests can no more stop that light from
shining or change its colour and its radiance than
Joshua could stop the sun and moon. [<i>Laughs

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Still without moving.</i>] I don't

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes, it is very dangerous. He
might meet a fairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> You went out in this sort of
weather and you met this sort of fairy, and so

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> But what are all those cries and gasps

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> The normal noises, I believe, of a

<div class="hanging"><p>[Quietly.] That last was a wonderful trick of yours.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Quietly.</i>] That last was a wonderful

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Thank you. I suppose you mean
it was the only one you didn't see through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Something of the kind, I confess.
Your last trick was the best trick I have ever seen.
It is so good that I wish you had not done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> And so do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> How do you mean? Do you wish you
had never been a conjurer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I wish I had never been born.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> It is all right so far. We have
brought him back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Drawing near to him.</i>] You told me
there was mental trouble with the girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Looking at him steadily.</i>] No. I
told you there was mental trouble in the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>After a silence.</i>] Where is Mr. Morris
Carleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I have got him into bed in the next
room. His sister is looking after him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> His sister! Oh, then do you believe
in fairies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Believe in fairies? What do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> At least you put the person who does
believe in them in charge of the person who
doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, I suppose I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You don't think she'll keep him awake
all night with fairy tales?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You don't think she'll throw the
medicine-bottle out of window and administer&mdash;er&mdash;a
dewdrop, or anything of that sort? Or a
four-leaved clover, say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> No; of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I only ask because you scientific men
are a little hard on us clergymen. You don't
believe in a priesthood; but you'll admit I'm more
really a priest than this Conjurer is really a magician.
You've been talking a lot about the Bible
and the Higher Criticism. But even by the Higher
Criticism the Bible is older than the language of
the elves&mdash;which was, as far as I can make out,
invented this afternoon. But Miss Carleon believed
in the wizard. Miss Carleon believed in the
language of the elves. And you put her in charge
of an invalid without a flicker of doubt: because
you trust women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Very seriously.</i>] Yes, I trust
women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You trust a woman with the practical
issues of life and death, through sleepless hours
when a shaking hand or an extra grain would kill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> But if the woman gets up to go to
early service at my church, you call her weak-minded
and say that nobody but women can
believe in religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I should never call this woman weak-minded&mdash;no,
by God, not even if she went to
church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yet there are many as strong-minded
who believe passionately in going to church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Weren't there as many who believed
passionately in Apollo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> And what harm came of believing in
Apollo? And what a mass of harm may have
come of not believing in Apollo? Does it never
strike you that doubt can be a madness, as well be
faith? That asking questions may be a disease,
as well as proclaiming doctrines? You talk of
religious mania! Is there no such thing as irreligious
mania? Is there no such thing in the house
at this moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Then you think no one should question
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>With passion, pointing to the next
room.</i>] I think <i>that</i> is what comes of questioning!
Why can't you leave the universe alone and let it
mean what it likes? Why shouldn't the thunder
be Jupiter? More men have made themselves
silly by wondering what the devil it was if it wasn't
Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Looking at him.</i>] Do you believe in
your own religion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Returning the look equally steadily.</i>]
Suppose I don't: I should still be a fool to question
it. The child who doubts about Santa Claus has
insomnia. The child who believes has a good
night's rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> You are a Pragmatist.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>, <i>absent-mindedly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> That is what the lawyers call vulgar
abuse. But I do appeal to practise. Here is a
family over which you tell me a mental calamity
hovers. Here is the boy who questions everything
and a girl who can believe anything. Upon which
has the curse fallen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Talking about the Pragmatists. I'm
glad to hear.... Ah, very forward movement!
I suppose Roosevelt now.... [<i>Silence.</i>] Well,
we move you know, we move! First there was the
Missing Link. [<i>Silence.</i>] No! <i>First</i> there was
Protoplasm&mdash;and <i>then</i> there was the Missing Link;
and Magna Carta and so on. [<i>Silence.</i>] Why,
look at the Insurance Act!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I would rather not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Wagging a playful finger at him.</i>] Ah,
prejudice, prejudice! You doctors, you know!
Well, I never had any myself. [<i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Breaking the silence in unusual
exasperation.</i>] Any what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Firmly.</i>] Never had any Marconis
myself. Wouldn't touch 'em. [<i>Silence.</i>] Well,
I must speak to Hastings.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>, <i>aimlessly.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Exploding.</i>] Well, of all the....
[<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Smith</span>.] You asked me just now which
member of the family had inherited the family
madness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Yes; I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>In a low, emphatic voice.</i>] On my
living soul, I believe it must be the Duke.</p>

<div class="hanging2"><p><i>Room partly darkened, a table with a lamp on it, and
an empty chair. From room next door faint
and occasional sounds of the tossing or talking
of the invalid.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging2"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor Grimthorpe</span> <i>with a rather careworn
air, and a medicine bottle in his hand. He puts
it on the table, and sits down in the chair as if
keeping a vigil.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging2"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>, <i>carrying his bag, and cloaked for
departure. As he crosses the room the</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>
<i>rises and calls after him.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Forgive me, but may I detain you for
one moment? I suppose you are aware that&mdash;[<i>he
hesitates</i>] that there have been rather grave developments
in the case of illness which happened
after your performance. I would not say, of
course, because of your performance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Slightly encouraged, but speaking very
carefully.</i>] Nevertheless, mental excitement is
necessarily an element of importance in physiological
troubles, and your triumphs this evening
were really so extraordinary that I cannot pretend
to dismiss them from my patient's case. He is at
present in a state somewhat analogous to delirium,
but in which he can still partially ask and answer
questions. The question he continually asks is
how you managed to do your last trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Ah! My last trick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Now I was wondering whether we
could make any arrangement which would be fair
to you in the matter. Would it be possible for you
to give me in confidence the means of satisfying
this&mdash;this fixed idea he seems to have got. [<i>He
hesitates again, and picks his words more slowly.</i>]
This special condition of semi-delirious disputation
is a rare one, and connected in my experience
with rather unfortunate cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Looking at him steadily.</i>] Do you
mean he is going mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Rather taken aback for the first time.</i>]
Really, you ask me an unfair question. I could
not explain the fine shades of these things to a
layman. And even if&mdash;if what you suggest were
so, I should have to regard it as a professional
secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Still looking at him.</i>] And don't
you think you ask me a rather unfair question,
Dr. Grimthorpe? If yours is a professional secret,
is not mine a professional secret too? If you may
hide truth from the world, why may not I? You
don't tell your tricks. I don't tell my tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With some heat.</i>] Ours are not tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Reflectively.</i>] Ah, no one can be
sure of that till the tricks are told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> But the public can see a doctor's
cures as plain as....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes. As plain as they saw the red
lamp over his door this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Your secret, of
course, would be strictly kept by every one
involved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Oh, of course. People in delirium
always keep secrets strictly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> No one sees the patient but his sister
and myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Starts slightly.</i>] Yes, his sister. Is
she very anxious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>In a lower voice.</i>] What would you
suppose?</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<span class="smcap">Conjurer</span> <i>throws himself into the chair, his
cloak slipping back from his evening
dress. He ruminates for a short space
and then speaks.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Doctor, there are about a thousand
reasons why I should not tell you how I really did
that trick. But one will suffice, because it is the
most practical of all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well? And why shouldn't you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Because you wouldn't believe me
if I did.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>A silence, the</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>looking at him
curiously.</i></p></div>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>with papers in his hand.
His usual gaiety of manner has a rather
forced air, owing to the fact that by some
vague sick-room associations he walks as if
on tip-toe and begins to speak in a sort of
loud or shrill whisper. This he fortunately
forgets and falls into his more
natural voice.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span>] So very kind of you
to have waited, Professor. I expect Dr. Grimthorpe
has explained the little difficulty we are in
much better than I could. Nothing like the medical
mind for a scientific statement. [<i>Hazily.</i>]
Look at Ibsen.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Silence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Of course the Professor feels considerable
reluctance in the matter. He points out
that his secrets are an essential part of his profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Of course, of course. Tricks of the
trade, eh? Very proper, of course. Quite a case
of <i>noblesse oblige</i> [<i>Silence.</i>] But I dare say we
shall be able to find a way out of the matter. [<i>He
turns to the</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span>] Now, my dear sir, I hope
you will not be offended if I say that this ought to
be a business matter. We are asking you for a
piece of your professional work and knowledge,
and if I may have the pleasure of writing you a
cheque....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I thank your Grace, I have already
received my cheque from your secretary. You will
find it on the counterfoil just after the cheque you
so kindly gave to the Society for the Suppression
of Conjuring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Now I don't want you to take it in that
way. I want you to take it in a broader way.
Free, you know. [<i>With an expansive gesture.</i>]
Modern and all that! Wonderful man, Bernard
Shaw!</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Silence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With a slight cough, resuming.</i>] If
you feel any delicacy the payment need not be
made merely to you. I quite respect your feelings
in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Approvingly.</i>] Quite so, quite so.
Haven't you got a Cause or something? Everybody
has a cause now, you know. Conjurers'
widows or something of that kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>With restraint.</i>] No; I have no
widows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Then something like a pension or
annuity for any widows you may&mdash;er&mdash;procure.
[<i>Gaily opening his cheque-book and talking slang to
show there is no ill-feeling.</i>] Come, let me call it a
couple of thou.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span> <i>takes the cheque and looks at
it in a grave and doubtful way. As he
does so the</i> <span class="smcap">Rector</span> <i>comes slowly into the
room.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> You would really be willing to pay
a sum like this to know the way I did that
trick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I would willingly pay much more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I think I explained to you that the
case is serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>More and more thoughtful.</i>] You
would pay much more.... [<i>Suddenly.</i>] But suppose
I tell you the secret and you find there's
nothing in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> You mean that it's really quite
simple? Why, I should say that that would be the
best thing that could possibly happen. A little
healthy laughter is the best possible thing for
convalescence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Still looking gloomily at the cheque.</i>]
I do not think you will laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Reasoning genially.</i>] But as you say it
is something quite simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> It is the simplest thing there is in
the world. That is why you will not laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Almost nervously.</i>] Why, what do
you mean? What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] You will disbelieve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> And why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Because it is so simple. [<i>He springs
suddenly to his feet, the cheque still in his hand.</i>] You
ask me how I really did the last trick. I will tell
you how I did the last trick. I did it by magic.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>stare at him motionless;
but the</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. Smith</span> <i>starts and takes
a step nearer the table. The</i> <span class="smcap">Conjurer</span>

gesture, as of departure, brings the</i>
<span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>to his feet.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>Astonished and angry.</i>] Do you really
mean that you take the cheque and then tell us it
was only magic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Pulling the cheque to pieces.</i>] I
tear the cheque, and I tell you it was only magic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> [<i>With violent sincerity.</i>] But hang it
all, there's no such thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes there is. I wish to God I did
not know that there is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> [<i>Rising also.</i>] Why, really, magic....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Contemptuously.</i>] Yes, your Grace,
one of those larger laws you were telling us about.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>He buttons his cloak up at his throat and
takes up his bag. As he does so the</i>
<span class="smcap">Rev. Smith</span> <i>steps between him and the

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>In a low voice.</i>] One moment, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I want to apologize to you. I mean on
behalf of the company. I think it was wrong to
offer you money. I think it was more wrong to
mystify you with medical language and call the
thing delirium. I have more respect for conjurer's
patter than for doctor's patter. They are both
meant to stupify; but yours only to stupify for a
moment. Now I put it to you in plain words and
on plain human Christian grounds. Here is a poor
boy who may be going mad. Suppose you had a
son in such a position, would you not expect people
to tell you the whole truth if it could help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Yes. And I have told you the
whole truth. Go and find out if it helps you.</p>

<div class="hanging"><p>[<i>Turns again to go, but more irresolutely.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You know quite well it will not help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> You know quite well why not. You are
an honest man; and you have said it yourself.
Because he would not believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>With a sort of fury.</i>] Well, does
anybody believe it? Do you believe it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>With great restraint.</i>] Your question is
quite fair. Come, let us sit down and talk about
it. Let me take your cloak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I will take off my cloak when you
take off your coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Why? Do you want me to
fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] I want you to be
martyred. I want you to <i>bear</i> witness to your own
creed. I say these things are supernatural. I say
this was done by a spirit. The Doctor does not
believe me. He is an agnostic; and he knows
everything. The Duke does not believe me; he
cannot believe anything so plain as a miracle.
But what the devil are you for, if you don't believe
in a miracle? What does your coat mean, if
it doesn't mean that there is such a thing as
the supernatural? What does your cursed collar
mean if it doesn't mean that there is such a thing
as a spirit? [<i>Exasperated.</i>] Why the devil do
you dress up like that if you don't believe in
it? [<i>With violence.</i>] Or perhaps you don't believe
in devils?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I believe.... [<i>After a pause.</i>] I wish I
could believe.</p>

poor brother was rude to you. He's rude to everybody!
[<i>Breaks down.</i>] But he's such a little, little
boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I suppose you know there are
things men never tell to women. They are too
horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Yes. And there are things women
never tell to men. They also are too horrible. I
am here to hear them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Do you really mean I may say
anything I like? However dark it is? However
dreadful it is? However damnable it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I have gone through too much to be
terrified now. Tell me the very worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I will tell you the very worst. I
fell in love with you when I first saw you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Drawing back.</i>] You told me I
looked like a child and....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I told a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> O; this is terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I was in love, I took an opportunity.
You believed quite simply that I was a
magician? but I....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> It is terrible. It is terrible. I never
believed you were a magician.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Astounded.</i>] Never believed I was
a magician...!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I always knew you were a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Doing whatever passionate things
people do on the stage.</i>] I am a man. And you are a
woman. And all the elves have gone to elfland,
and all the devils to hell. And you and I will walk
out of this great vulgar house and be married....
Every one is crazy in this house to-night, I think.
What am I saying? As if <i>you</i> could marry <i>me</i>! O
my God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> This is the first time you have failed
in courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I mean to draw your attention to the
fact that you have recently made an offer, I accept
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Oh, it's nonsense, it's nonsense.
How can a man marry an archangel, let alone a
lady. My mother was a lady and she married a
dying fiddler who tramped the roads; and the
mixture plays the cat and banjo with my body and
soul. I can see my mother now cooking food in
dirtier and dirtier lodgings, darning socks with
weaker and weaker eyes when she might have worn
pearls by consenting to be a rational person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> And she might have grown pearls, by
consenting to be an oyster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] There was little
pleasure in her life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> There is little, a very little, in everybody's.
The question is, what kind? We can't
turn life into a pleasure. But we can choose
such pleasures as are worthy of us and our
immortal souls. Your mother chose and I have
chosen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Staring.</i>] Immortal souls!...
And I suppose if I knelt down to worship you, you
and every one else would laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>With a smile of perversity.</i>] Well, I
think this is a more comfortable way. [<i>She sits
down suddenly beside him in a sort of domestic way
and goes on talking.</i>] Yes. I'll do everything your
mother did, not so well, of course; I'll darn that
conjurer's hat&mdash;does one darn hats?&mdash;and cook
the Conjurer's dinner. By the way, what is a
Conjurer's dinner? There's always the goldfish, of
course....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>With a groan.</i>] Carrots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> And, of course, now I come to think
of it, you can always take rabbits out of the hat.
Why, what a cheap life it must be! How do
you cook rabbits? The Duke is always talking
about poached rabbits. Really, we shall be as
happy as is good for us. We'll have confidence in
each other at least, and no secrets. I insist on
knowing all the tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I don't think I know whether I'm
on my head or my heels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> And now, as we're going to be so
confidential and comfortable, you'll just tell me
the real, practical, tricky little way you did that
last trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Rising, rigid with horror.</i>] How I
did that trick? I did it by devils. [<i>Turning furiously
on</i> <span class="smcap">Patricia</span>.] You could believe in fairies.
Can't you believe in devils?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] No, I can't believe in
devils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Well, this room is full of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What does it all mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> It only means that I have done
what many men have done; but few, I think, have
thriven by. [<i>He sits down and talks thoughtfully.</i>]
I told you I had mixed with many queer sets of
people. Among others, I mixed with those who
pretend, truly and falsely, to do our tricks by the
aid of spirits. I dabbled a little in table-rapping
and table-turning. But I soon had reason to give
it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Why did you give it up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> It began by giving me headaches.
And I found that every morning after a Spiritualist
<i>s&eacute;ance</i> I had a queer feeling of lowness and degradation,
of having been soiled; much like the feeling,
I suppose, that people have the morning after they
have been drunk. But I happen to have what
people call a strong head; and I have never been
really drunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I am glad of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> It hasn't been for want of trying.
But it wasn't long before the spirits with whom I
had been playing at table-turning, did what I
think they generally do at the end of all such
table-turning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> What did they do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> They turned the tables. They
turned the tables upon me. I don't wonder at your
believing in fairies. As long as these things were
my servants they seemed to me like fairies. When
they tried to be my masters.... I found they
were not fairies. I found the spirits with whom I at
least had come in contact were evil ... awfully,
unnaturally evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Did they say so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Don't talk of what they said. I
was a loose fellow, but I had not fallen so low as
such things. I resisted them; and after a pretty
bad time, psychologically speaking, I cut the
connexion. But they were always tempting me
to use the supernatural power I had got from them.
It was not very great, but it was enough to move
things about, to alter lights, and so on. I don't
know whether you realize that it's rather a strain
on a man to drink bad coffee at a coffee-stall when
he knows he has just enough magic in him to make
a bottle of champagne walk out of an empty shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> I think you behaved very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] And when I fell at last it
was for nothing half so clean and Christian as
champagne. In black blind pride and anger and
all kinds of heathenry, because of the impudence
of a schoolboy, I called on the fiends and they
obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> [<i>Touches his arm.</i>] Poor fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Your goodness is the only goodness
that never goes wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> And what <i>are</i> we to do with Morris?
I&mdash;I believe you now, my dear. But he&mdash;he will
never believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> There is no bigot like the atheist.
I must think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Really, you have doubled your claim
to originality!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> It is much more marvellous to explain a
miracle than to work a miracle. What was your
explanation, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I shall not tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> [<i>Starting.</i>] Indeed? Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Because God and the demons and
that Immortal Mystery that you deny has been
in this room to-night. Because you know it has
been here. Because you have felt it here. Because
you know the spirits as well as I do and fear them
as much as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> Because all this would not avail.
If I told you the lie I told Morris Carleon about
how I did that trick....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer. You</span> would believe it as he believed
it. You cannot think [<i>pointing to the lamp</i>] how
that trick could be done naturally. I alone found
out how it could be done&mdash;after I had done it by
magic. But if I tell you a natural way of doing
it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Well?...</p>

a saint can be a temptress as well as a sinner. I

a little left. We began with a fairy tale. Have I
any right to take advantage of that fairy tale?
Has not that fairy tale really and truly come to an
end?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> Yes. That fairy tale has really and
truly come to an end. [<i>Looks at him a little in the
old mystical manner.</i>] It is very hard for a fairy
tale to come to an end. If you leave it alone it
lingers everlastingly. Our fairy tale has come to
an end in the only way a fairy tale can come to an
end. The only way a fairy tale can leave off being
a fairy tale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjurer.</span> I don't understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patricia.</span> It has come true.</p>

LADY GREGORY</h3>

<h4><i>8&deg;. With Portrait in Photogravure. $1.50 net. By mail, $1.65</i></h4>

<p>The plays have been acted with great success by the Abbey Company, and
have been highly extolled by appreciative audiences and an enthusiastic
press. They are distinguished by a humor of unchallenged originality.</p>

<p>One of the plays in the collection, "Coats," depends for its plot upon
the rivalry of two editors, each of whom has written an obituary notice
of the other. The dialogue is full of crisp humor. "McDonough's Wife,"
another drama that appears in the volume, is based on a legend, and
explains how a whole town rendered honor against its will. "The Bogie
Men" has as its underlying situation an amusing misunderstanding of two
chimney-sweeps. The wit and absurdity of the dialogue are in Lady
Gregory's best vein. "Damer's Gold" contains the story of a miser beset
by his gold-hungry relations. Their hopes and plans are upset by one
they had believed to be of the simple of the world, but who confounds
the Wisdom of the Wise. "The Full Moon" presents a little comedy enacted
on an Irish railway station. It is characterized by humor of an original
and delightful character and repartee that is distinctly clever.</p>

<div class="bbox"><h2>Irish Plays</h2>
<h3>By<br />
LADY GREGORY</h3>


<p>Lady Gregory's name has become a household word in America and her works
should occupy an exclusive niche in every library. Mr. George Bernard
Shaw, in a recently published interview, said Lady Gregory "is the
greatest living Irishwoman.... Even in the plays of Lady Gregory,
penetrated as they are by that intense love of Ireland which is
unintelligible to the many drunken blackguards with Irish names who make
their nationality an excuse for their vices and their worthlessness,
there is no flattery of the Irish; she writes about the Irish as Moli&egrave;re
wrote about the French, having a talent curiously like Moli&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"The witchery of Yeats, the vivid imagination of Synge, the amusing
literalism mixed with the pronounced romance of their imitators, have
their place and have been given their praise without stint. But none of
these can compete with Lady Gregory for the quality of universality. The
best beauty in Lady Gregory's art is its spontaneity. It is never
forced.... She has read and dreamed and studied, and slept and wakened
and worked, and the great ideas that have come to her have been
nourished and trained till they have grown to be of great
stature."&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>Lady Gregory has preferred going for her material to the traditional
folk-history rather than to the authorized printed versions, and she has
been able, in so doing, to make her plays more living. One of these,
<b>Kincora</b>, telling of Brian Boru, who reigned in the year 1000, evoked
such keen local interest that an old farmer travelled from the
neighborhood of Kincora to see it acted in Dublin.</p>

<p>The story of <b>Grania</b>, on which Lady Gregory has founded one of these
plays, was taken entirely from tradition. Grania was a beautiful young
woman and was to have been married to Finn, the great leader of the
Fenians; but before the marriage, she went away from the bridegroom with
his handsome young kinsman, Diarmuid. After many years, when Diarmuid
had died (and Finn had a hand in his death), she went back to Finn and
became his queen.</p>

<p>Another of Lady Gregory's plays, <b>The Canavans</b> dealt with the stormy
times of Queen Elizabeth, whose memory is a horror in Ireland second
only to that of Cromwell.</p>

<p><b>The White Cockade</b> is founded on a tradition of King James having escaped
from Ireland after the battle of the Boyne in a wine barrel.</p>

<p>The choice of folk history rather than written history gives a freshness
of treatment and elasticity of material which made the late J.M. Synge
say that "Lady Gregory's method had brought back the possibility of
writing historic plays."</p>

<p>All these plays, except <b>Grania</b>, which has not yet been staged, have been
very successfully performed in Ireland. They are written in the dialect
of Kiltartan, which had already become familiar to leaders of Lady
Gregory's books.</p>

<p>"By common consent, London has witnessed this week a play of serious
importance, not approached by any other book or drama of the season,
John Galsworthy's 'The Strife.' It is regarded not merely as a
remarkable social document of significance, but as a creation which,
while of the most modern realism, is yet classic in its pronounced art
and exalted philosophy. The play shows the types of the strongest men as
victims of comical events and of weaker men. It will be produced in
America, where, on account of its realistic treatment of the subject of
labor union, it is sure to be a sensation."&mdash;<i>Special cable dispatch to

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
